This is a web-app agent for the raspberry pi. It allows you to interact easily with your Pi via your browser. 

For users:
Install this application to your Raspberry Pi via the pistore:
http://store.raspberrypi.com/projects/pi-web-agent

The product can be installed on the Raspberry Pi. Then run:
sudo /etc/init.d/pi-web-agent start
to start the apache2 instance that serves the application.
Access the appliation via:
https://raspberrypi:8003
Default username and password is admin. If raspberrypi does not work on the browser address bar use
the full ip as your internet router may not match the hostnames.

This product is in beta version. Report any problems to help us make the final release soon.

== Developer Information ==
If you are a developer and you want to test or work on this project you don't need to work on a raspberrypi. You just need
a virtual machine that runs something similar to the raspberry pi Raspbian. Here is how we did it:

1. Download and install Virtual box. Download this image http://dl.dropbox.com/u/60623239/RaspberryPi.VirtualBox.zip (it's a 
zip, extract the torrent file that is inside and open it with your torrent client. Open the downloaded file with virtual box. Now you have ubuntu on your virtual
machine that looks like the raspberry pi. It is good enough for testing. Default username=rpi password=password .

2. Install git (sudo apt-get install git-core)
Clone the project (git clone https://github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent)
Go into the directory (pi-web-agent), there is a file setup.sh. Run sudo ./setup.sh install . 
If that fails run sudo ./setup.sh reinstall . It should work by also installing some of the dependencies. You have to install
manually (at the moment) the dependencies described just above (sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-dnssd) etc...

3. Start the pi-web-agent service: sudo pi-web-agent start

4. Set up a host only adapter on your virtual box if you want to access it from your normal browser. 
The ip to access the application from a browser inside the virtual machine is: http://127.0.0.1:8004
The ip to access the application from your PC (the host) is https://192.168.56.101:8003 if you set up things correctly (see
below how to set up network interface)

== How to set up the network interface ==
1. Shut down the virtual machine that runs the Ubuntu mod. From the Virtual box program go to File->preferences->Network
and add a host only adapter if there is not already one in the list.
2. Select the RaspberryPi virtual machine and press settings. Go to network->adapter2 and select host-only-adapter option
at the Attached to. Select your host only adapter you created on step 1 if it is not already selected and press ok.
3. Launch the RaspberryPi Virtual Machine again and then:
  a) open terminal (inside the VM)
  b) check the interface that is down ifconfig -a (eth1 or eth2)
  c) sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
  d) copy paste this below the other content of the file
    # The host-only network interface
    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.56.101
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.56.0
    broadcast 192.168.56.255
4. Reboot (or restart the network service)

Now you can access the application via your browser on your host pc that runs the virtual machine by putting in the
address bar:
https://192.168.56.101:8003
